## Can Sarah [Drasner's ecommerce-netlify](https://github.com/sdras/ecommerce-netlify) be more amazing?

# Yeah, it can be PWAmazing!

The motivation of this repository is to show the transformation of a project into a PWA in demo time for my JSNight 2019.2 and JSDay Canarias 2019 talks

We will use two different approaches, using the [@nuxtjs/pwa](https://pwa.nuxtjs.org/) module and [Google's Workbox Libraries](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox)

- Give you offline capabilities
- Make it installable on different devices
- Use of runtime cache
- Different caching strategies
- The use of precaching
- Friendly handling of application updates
- Offline Google Analytics with background synchronization
- Push notifications [WIP]
- ...
- More to come!
